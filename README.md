# Helix configuration

> This is made for linux, go away, wicked windows user!

This is my helix configuration, clone this at a location `~/.config/helix`.

Contains a setup script that installs npm(through nvm), python(through uv), go with utility packages, general linux packages, and rust(through rustup). It uses snap and assumes your distro has apt, but if you have snap on another distro, you can skip the apt calls
